 :Description:
   This routine enables the user to resample an MAVEN insitu KP data 
   structure to an arbitrary time cadence.
   Used in conjunction with mvn_kp_add_data, this enables the user to 
   modify and extend the KP data (with additional Level-2 data, for 
   example), yet still use the plotting and visualization components of 
   the Toolkit.

 :Params:
    kp_data: in, required, type=structure
      This is the original insitu KP data structure from the rest of the 
      toolkit that is to be resampled.
    time: in, required, type=intarr, strarr
      An array of times to which the input data structure is to be 
      resampled. This routine does not extrapolate,
      so the time array must be completely within the time range of the 
      input data structure.
    data_out: out, required, type=structure
      The KP data structure resampled to the given time cadence.

 :Keywords:
    sc_only: in, optional, type=boolean
     By default, this routine will resample all the KP data within the 
     input structure. Using this keyword, the user can force the routine 
     to only resample the SPACECRAFT substructure.  Mostly this would be 
     useful for using the visualization routines with arbitrary non-KP data.
    help: in, optional, type=boolean
