 Function to return the model output interpolated to a given spacecraft 
 trajectory

 :Author: Kevin McGouldrick (2015-Apr-15)

 :Description:
     Parse a NetCDF file with modeled data results and return in three data
     structures.  In order to work correctly with the toolkit, modeled
     data must conform to our modeled results file requirements
     - FIXME say where this is hosted.

 :Keywords:
    kp_data: in, required, type=struct
       Key Parameter data file containing spacecraft trajectory information.

    model_meta: in, required, type=struct
       Structure containing relevant model metadata.

    model_dims: in, required, type=struct
       Structure containing relevant model dimension information.

    model_data: in, required, type=struct
       Structure containing relevant model data.
       
    help: optional: opens a window describing the function

  :Returns:
    model_interpol: out, type=TBD
       Object containing the model tracers interpolated to the provided 
       spacecraft trajectory from the kp_data
