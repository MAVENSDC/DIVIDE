 :Description:
    Convert a model cube and its metadata into an a structure of arrays
    interpolated to the spacecraft trajectory given by kp_data

 :Keywords:
    kp_data: in, required, type=struct
       Key Parameter data file containing spacecraft trajectory information.

    model: in, required, type=struct
       Structure containing relevant model metadata, dimensions, and data
       
    file: in, required, type=string
       File path containing the directory of the model file you want to read in.
       This is only required if "model" is not provided

    model_interpol: out, required, type=struct
       Structure containing the model tracers interpolated to the provided
       spacecraft trajectory from the kp_data
       
    nearest: out, required, type=struct
       Finds the nearest neighbor to the spacecraft rather than interpolate

    help: optional: opens a window describing the function
