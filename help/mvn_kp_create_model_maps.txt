 Creates contour plots from model data

 :Author: Bryan Harter

 :Description:
     Takes the 3 data structures from mvn_kp_model_results and takes a slice
     from them at a certain altitude.  A contour plot is made from the data, 
     which can then be used in mvn_kp_map2d or mvn_kp_3d.  The contour plot
     is saved as a png in the same directory as the model data.

 :Keywords:
    altitude: in, required, type=integer
       Height, in kilometers, that the user wants the data

    file: in, optional, type=file path string
       The path and file name to the model data you want to plot.  If this
       is not specified, then a window will appear asking the user to select
       a file

    interp: in, optional, type=boolean
       If this flag is set, the data will be interpolated if the user
       specifies an altitude that is between two model layers.  Otherwise,
       the contour plot will be of the closest altitude layer

    numContourLines: in, optional, type=integer
       The user can specify the number of contour lines in the output contour
       Default is 25 contour lines
       
    fill: in, optional, type=boolean
       If this flag is selected, the contour plot fills in the levels
       with a certain color. 

    ct: in, optional, type=integer array 256x3
       The user can specify a color table for the contour plot.  The 
       default is the array given by COLORTABLE(72, /REVERSE)
       
    basemap: in, optional, type=string
       If either 'mdim', 'mola', 'mola_bw', or 'mag is specified, the
       contour will be overlaid on one of these basemaps with 50%
       transparency
       
    contourtransparency: in, optional, type=integer
       The user can specify the level of transparency in the contour plot. 
       Useful when plotting the contour over a basemap.  Must be a number
       between 0 (no transparency) and 100 (completely transparent)
