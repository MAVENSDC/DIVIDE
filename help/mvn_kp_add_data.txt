 :Description: 
    A simple routine for adding up to 9 user defined data arrays to the 
    insitu KP data structure
    RESTRICTIONS: The new data arrays must be of the same length and 
    time cadence as the input structure.  If this is not the case, 
    use mvn_kp_resample first to build a new data structure that 
    matches the data field.
       
    All new data fields will be added to a USER substructure. 
    This name is required for later use by the 3d vis. routine.   

 :Params:
    kp_data : in, required, type="structure"
       the original insitu KP data structure
    data_name : in, required, type="string"
       the name of the new data to be added onto the USER substructure, 
       either a single string or an array of strings equal in length to 
       the number of new data fields.
    output : out, required, type="structure"
       the name of the newly created data structure
    data : in, required, type=array
       The variable(s) to be appended to the input data structure.
       Number of added variables MUST equal the number of elements
       in data_name
