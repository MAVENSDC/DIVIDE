* MVN_KP_ADD_DATA *
*******************

   A simple routine for adding user defined data arrays 
   to the insitu KP data structure

   ** RESTRICTIONS **: 
       The new data arrays must be of the same length and time cadence as the 
       input structure.
       If this is not the case, use mvn_kp_resample first to build a new data 
       structure that matches the data field.
       All new data fields will be added to a USER substructure. 
       This name is required for later use by the 3d vis. routine.

  data_name : the name(s) of the new data to be added onto the USER substructure, 
              either a single string or an array of strings equal in length 
              to the number of new data fields.
  output: the data array(s) to be added to the kp data structure.
          The number of listed arrays MUST equal the number of data_name
