 :Description:
     Parse a NetCDF file with modeled data results and return in three data 
     structures.  In order to work correctly with the toolkit, modeled 
     data must conform to our modeled results file requirements 
     - FIXME say where this is hosted.
     
 :Keywords:
    file: in, required, type=string or strarr
       Scalar of path & filename of NetCDF file

    output: out, required, type=struct
       Output named variable containing three substructures: 
        - a struct with meta information about the modeled results.
        - a struct with dimension information about the modeled results.
        - a struct containing an array of pointers where each 
          element is one modeled species (stored in a struct with 'name' 
          and 'data' tags).
