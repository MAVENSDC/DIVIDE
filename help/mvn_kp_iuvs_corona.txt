* MVN_KP_IUVS_CORONA *
**********************

  This routine plots all the coronal scan data held within the 
  IUVS KP structure in a variety of ways.
  By default, calling this routine with just the data structure defined will 
  plot ALL the coronal data.

REQUIRED FIELDS
**************
  kp_data: IUVS Key Parameter Data Structure

OPTIONAL FIELDS
***************
  echelle: Used to plot the Echelle coronal data. Can be used in conjunction
           with /lores, but that is equivalent to using neither.
  lores: Used to plot the LoRes coronal data. Can be used in conjunction with
         /echelle, but that is equivalent to using neither.
  disk: Used to plot all the Disk Coronal data within the structure.
        This keyword may be used in conjunction with /limb and /high, as well 
        as /echelle and /lores, to show the desired subset of IUVS data.
  limb: Used to plot all the Limb Coronal Scan data within the input structure.
        This keyword may be used in conjunction with /disk and /high, as well 
        as /echelle and /lores, to show the desired subset of IUVS data.
  high: Used to plot all the High Altitude Coronal Scan data within the 
        input structure
        This keyword may be used in conjunction with /disk and /limb, as well 
        as /echelle and /lores, to show the desired subset of IUVS data.
  range: Used to print the beginning and end times/orbits contained within the 
         input data structure.
         Using this keyword will result in no plot being produced.
  colortable: This variable is the integer index of a pre-defined IDL color 
              table. By default, the routine will use #39 (Rainbow+White).
  nolabels: Suppress the labels on each plot.
  nolegend: Suppress the additional legend windows created by the routine.
  window: If this keyword is used, the currently displayed idl direct 
          graphic plot windows are retained.  Useful for making 
          multiple plots to compare different coronal scans.
