 :Description:
   This routine plots all the coronal scan data held within the 
   IUVS KP structure in a variety of ways.
   By default, calling this routine with just the data structure defined 
   will plot ALL the coronal data.
   
 :Params:
   kp_data: in, required, type=structure
     This is the MAVEN IUVS KP data structure. It should contain at least 
     some Coronal Scan observations to plot.
   colortable, in, optional, type=integer
     This variable is the integer index of a pre-defined IDL color table. 
     By default, the routine will use #39 (Rainbow+White).
 
 :Keywords:
   echelle: in, optional, type=boolean
     Used to plot the Echelle coronal data. Can be used in conjunction 
     with /lores, but that is equivalent to using neither.
   lores: in, optional, type=boolean
     Used to plot the LoRes coronal data. Can be used in conjunction 
     with /echelle, but that is equivalent to using niether.
   disk: in, optional, type=boolean
     Used to plot all the Disk Coronal data within the structure.
     This keyword may be used in conjunction with /limb and /high, as well 
     as /echelle and /lores, to show the desired subset of IUVS data.
   limb: in, optional, type=boolean
     Used to plot all the Limb Coronal Scan data within the input structure.
     This keyword may be used in conjunction with /disk and /high, as well 
     as /echelle and /lores, to show the desired subset of IUVS data.
   high: in, optional, type=boolean
     Used to plot all the High Altitude Coronal Scan data within the 
     input structure
     This keyword may be used in conjunction with /disk and /limb, as well 
     as /echelle and /lores, to show the desired subset of IUVS data.
   range: in, optional, type=boolean
     Used to print the beginning and end times/orbits contained within the 
     input data structure. 
     Using this keyword will result in no plot. 
   nolabels: in, optional, type=boolean
     Used to suppress the labels on each plot.
   nolegend: in, optional, type=boolean
     Used to suppress the additional legend windows created by the routine. 
   window: in, optional, type=boolean
     If this keyword is used, the currently displayed idl direct graphic 
     plot windows are retained.
     Useful for making multiple plots to compare different coronal scans.
